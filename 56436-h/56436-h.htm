FORT DEARBORN</h2>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here the old Fort stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the river bent southward.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now because the world pours itself into Chicago<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Lake runs into the river<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Past docks and switch-yards,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And under bridges of iron.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sand dunes stretched along the lake for miles.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was a great forest in the Loop.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now Michigan Avenue lies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between miles of lights,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Rialto blazes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the wolf howled.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In the loneliness of the log-cabin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across the river,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fur-trader played his fiddle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the snow lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About the camp of the Pottawatomies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the great forest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now to the music of the Kangaroo Hop,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Ragging the Scale,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_2" id="page_2">[2]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And La Seduccion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The boys and girls are dancing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a cafe near Lake Street.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The world is theirs now.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is neither a past nor a to-morrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save of dancing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor do they know that behind them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the seed not yet sown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There are eyes which will open upon Chicago,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And feet which will blossom for the dance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hands which will reach up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And push them into the silence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the old fiddler.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They threw a flag<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the coffin of Lieutenant Farnum<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And buried him back of the Fort<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In ground where now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spice mills stand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his little squaw with a baby<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sat on the porch grieving<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the band played.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then hands pushing the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Buried a million soldiers and afterward<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pale multitudes swept through the Court-house<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To gaze for the last time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the shrunken face of Lincoln.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_3" id="page_3">[3]</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the fort at thirty-fifth street vanished.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where the Little Giant lived<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They made a park<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And put his statue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon a column of marble.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now the glare of the steel mills at South Chicago<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lights the bronze brow of Douglas.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is his great sorrow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Haunting the Lake at mid-night.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When the South was beaten<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They were playing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">John Brown’s body lies mouldering in the Grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Babylon is Fallen and Wake Nicodemus.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now the boys and girls are dancing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the Merry Whirl and Hello Frisco<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where they waltzed in crinoline<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the Union was saved.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There was the Marble Terrace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glory of the seventies!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They wrecked it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And brought colors and figures<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From later Athens and Pompeii<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And put them on walls.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And beneath panels of red and gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shimmering tesseræ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tragic masks and comic masks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_4" id="page_4">[4]</a></span><br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I had an uncle back in Ireland<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who failed at everything except his Latin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He could spout Virgil till your head would ache.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when I was a boy he used to roll<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Latin out, translating as he went:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ghost of Hector comes before Æneas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And warns him to leave Troy. His mother Venus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tells him to settle in another land!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Delphic oracle misunderstood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Æneas goes to Crete. He finds at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His ships are fired by the Trojan women,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great conflagration! Down he goes to hell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then the Sibyl shows him what’s to be:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What race of heroes shall descend from him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_8" id="page_8">[8]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how a city’s walls he shall up-build<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In founding Rome....<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">So last night in my dream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This uncle came to me and said to me:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>Aeneas’ Whistler you shall found a city.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You’ve built Fort Dearborn, that is the beginning.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Imperial Rome could be put in a corner<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of this, the city which you’ll found. Fear not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wooden horse, but have a care for cows:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I see ships burning on your muddy Tiber,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And toppling walls.” I dreamed I felt the heat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But then a voice said “Where’s your little boy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">George Washington?”&mdash;come sit on father’s knee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hear about my dream&mdash;there little boy!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, as I said, I felt the heat and then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I felt the cruelest cold and then the voice:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“You cannot come to Russia with your boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He’ll make his way.” I woke up with these words,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And found the covers off and I was cold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then no sooner did I fall asleep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than this old uncle re-appeared and said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“A race of heroes shall descend from you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here shall a city stand greater than Rome.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With that he seemed to alter to a witch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A woman’s form, the voice of him changed too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said: “I’m Mother Shipton, Captain Whistler.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Men through the mountains then shall ride,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_9" id="page_9">[9]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Nor horse nor ass be by their side”&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Think, gentlemen, what it would be to ride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In carriages propelled by steam! And then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This dream became a wonder in a wonder<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of populous streets, of flying things, of spires<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of driven mist that looked like fiddle strings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From tree to tree. Of smoke-stacks over-topping<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tallest pine; of bridges built of levers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And such a haze of smoke, and cloud like shapes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Passing along like etchings one by one:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cathedrals, masts as thick as hazel thickets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And buildings great as hills, and miles of lights.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till by some miracle the sun had moved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rose not in the east but in the south.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shone along the shore line of the Lake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he shines o’er the Lake when he arises,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And makes an avenue of gold, no less<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This yellow sand took glory of his light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where he shone it seemed an avenue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And over it, where now the dunes stretch south,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the level shore of sand, there stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These giant masses, etchings as it were!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Mother Shipton said: “This is your city.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“A race of heroes shall descend from you;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Your son George Washington shall do great deeds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“And if he had a son what would you name him?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, as I went to sleep with thoughts of Sarah<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And praises for James Abbott, it was natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_10" id="page_10">[10]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I should say “I’d name him after James.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Well done” said Mother Shipton and then vanished....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I woke to find the sun-light in my room,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from my barracks window saw the Lake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stirred up to waves slate-colored by the wind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some Indians loitering about the fort.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They knew this was James Abbott’s wedding day,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I call this heaven, for its youth and love!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’m sixteen and you’re twenty and I love you.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I slip my arm through yours for you to lead me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You are so strong, so ruddy, kind and brave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I want you for a husband, for a friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A guide, a solace, father to the child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I can bear. Oh Jean how can I talk so<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this lone church at mid-night of such things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all these candles burning round your face.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I who have rounded ninety-years, and look<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On what was sweet, long seventy years ago?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feeling this city even at mid-night move<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In restlessness, desire, around this church,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_17" id="page_17">[17]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where once I saw the prairie grass and flowers;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saw the Indians in their colored trappings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pour from a bottle of whisky on the fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tribute to the Spirit of the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dance and sing for madness of that Spirit?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Well, Jean, my other hour. I’ve spoken before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of our long life together glad and sad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But mostly good. I’m happy for it all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This other hour is marked, I call it heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just as I told you, not because they stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around me as a mystery from the past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And looked at me admiringly for my age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My strength in age, my life that spanned the growth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of my Chicago from a place of huts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just four or five, a fort, and all around it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wilderness, to what it is this hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where most three million souls are living, nor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because I saw this rude life, and beheld<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The World’s Fair where such richnesses of time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were spread before me&mdash;not because of these,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor for the ninety roses, nor the tribute<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They paid me in them, nor their gentle words&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These did not make that hour a heaven, no&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jean, it was this:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">First I was just as happy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I was on that night we danced together.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_18" id="page_18">[18]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that I could repeat that hour’s great bliss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At ninety years, though in a different way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for a different cause, that was the thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That made me happy. For you see it proves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just give the soul a chance it’s happiness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is endless, let the body house it well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or house it ill, but give it but a chance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To speak itself, not stifle it, or hush it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With hands of flesh against the quivering strings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made sick or weak by time, the soul will find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Delights as good as youth has to the end.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And even if the flesh be sick there’s Heine:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Few men had raptures keen as his, though lying<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With death beside him through a stretch of years.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It must be something in the soul as well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which makes me think a third hour shall be mine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In spite of death, yes Jean it must be so!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I want that third hour, I shall pray for it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unceasingly, I want it for my soul’s sake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which will have happiness in its very power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dignity that time nor change can hurt.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For if I have it you shall have it too.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in that third hour we shall give each other<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Something that’s kindred to the souls we gave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That night we danced together&mdash;but much more!...<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Now this was the point:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was that devilish thing slavery,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And The Little Giant, as senator,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Put through a bill for leaving it to the people<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether they would have slavery in Kansas or Nebraska,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or any other territory, and that was popular sovereignty&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sounds democratic; but three years later<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along comes the Supreme Court and says:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The people of a territory must have slavery<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether they want it or not, because<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The constitution is for slavery, and it follows the flag!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, there was The Little Giant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Caught between the law and the constitution!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tryin’ to obey ’em both!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or better still he was like Lem Reese’s boy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who was standin’ one time one foot on shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one in a skiff, baitin’ a hook,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all at once Col. Lankford’s little steamer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came along and bobbled the skiff;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it started to glide out into the river,&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For the skiff was movin’, and that’s the law.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his other foot slipped on the slimy bank,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that’s the constitution!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But if you want to consider a minute<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How Time plays tag with people,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how no one can tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he’ll be It, just think:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Who wanted to send it everywhere,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Not even judges.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">And talked from the steps of the Court-house;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you never saw such a crowd of people:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Know-nothings and Anti-masonics,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A mile from the Court House steps,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To the black republicans in northern Illinois.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It made you shiver all down your spine<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And then on the other hand there was<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As any clown you ever saw,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As it were, you know, which would bobble the skiff,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which was the law; and The Little Giant’s other foot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would slip on the bank, which was the constitution.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you could almost hear him holler “ouch.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Linkern would say: This argument<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the Senator’s is thin as soup<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made from the shadow of a starved pigeon!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then the crowd would yell, and the cornet band<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would play, and men would walk away and say:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_30" id="page_30">[30]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Linkern floored him. And others would say:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He aint no match for The Little Giant.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Sounded good.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to have the constitution in force sounded good.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not to have any slavery at all sounded good.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But so far as the law was concerned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where it was, and what you could do with it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was like the shell game:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now you see the little ball and now you don’t!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who’s got a dollar to say where the little ball is?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But when you try to obey the laws and support the constitution,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It reminds me of a Campbellite preacher<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We had here years ago.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he debated with the Methodist preacher<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As to whether immersion or sprinkling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was the way to salvation.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Campbellite preacher said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“The holy scripture says:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘And Jesus when he was baptised<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went up straightway out of the water.’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how could he come up out of the water<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If he wasn’t in?” asked the Campbellite preacher,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_31" id="page_31">[31]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pointing a long finger at the Methodist preacher.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“And how could he be in without being immersed?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, the Campbellite preacher won the debate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the next day Billy Bell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An infidel we had here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Met the Campbellite preacher and said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“I suppose it wouldn’t be possible for a man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To stand in water up to his knees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And have water sprinkled on his head, would it?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Campbellite preacher said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Get thee behind me Satan,” and went on.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well Linkern was kind of an infidel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And The Little Giant got caught in his own orthodoxy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his ability for debate led him into<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The complete persuading of himself.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by arguin’ for the law<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He made Linkern appear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As bein’ against the law.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But just think, for a minute, young man:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here is The Little Giant the greatest figure in all the land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wheel of fortune turns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he stands by Linkern’s side and holds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hat while Linkern takes the oath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As president!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the war comes and his leadership<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has left him, and millions who followed him<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_32" id="page_32">[32]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turn from him, and then Death comes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sits by him and says: Your time’s up!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I say when they put up that monument<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And carved those words upon it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They had just as well have carved the words,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“He took poison.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Which reminds me:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was a family over at Dutchland<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That there is a writer named Nitchie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who says&mdash;well I can’t tell you just now.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if you’ll look at things close<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You’ll see that Linkern was against the legal law,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Douglas against the moral law so-called,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And neither cared for the other’s law&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that was the real debate!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Linkern rode over laws to save the Union,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Douglas said he cared more for white supremacy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than anything else.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which being true, who can tell<br /></span>

<span class="i0">What fish is so unfriendly to his fellows.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Just look at him,” he said, but as he spoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The black fly stung my hand again. When I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looked up from swatting him, the man had thrown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fish upon the sand, and a stray dog<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And when the opera came she was the queen,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To an Italian count kept state in Florence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Browning came, with whom our queen would fence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In spiritual dialectics. In her travels<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She had known Ibsen, Patti and George Eliot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sat as a dinner guest by Beaconsfield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And taken tea upon Hawarden’s lawn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so in escritoires and cabinets<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_87" id="page_87">[87]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">She kept mementoes of her days abroad:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like letters from George Eliot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Ferishtah’s Fancies” inscribed by Robert.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the course of time this three-floored house<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A man of any age. And master-men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Paid suit to her and gained<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stimulating richness of her mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some said they did not want her, others said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her wisdom and self-mastery froze their hearts.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when she spoke she said she could not change<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The name she loved, or change her place in life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To forced forgetfulness of that English face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who lifted up her life from some obscurity<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_88" id="page_88">[88]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made it flower.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At any rate she lived for forty years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With only maids and butlers in a house<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round which the warring city crept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until at last the street with lowered pulse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saw vacant mansions, as the mob psychology,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which sways in fashion, brought an exodus.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she knew no temptation to depart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This was her house, her center of the world.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the Countess left the Count she came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To ease her mother’s loneliness&mdash;oh yes!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Six months of loneliness was quite enough.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then in spite of everything she left,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Returned to Florence and her rascal count,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because she could not stand the loneliness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saw ahead long years of loneliness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In some bay window&mdash;no, it could not be!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so she left her mother sitting there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now sixty-eight or so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who watched the city pass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All now the swallow-gleam of limousines,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all around her now the boarding house,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">This Man’s life had four stages as I hear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first stage took him through the days of school<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fastened on his name a prophecy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he would win success. The second stage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Took him to thirty years while he was fumbling<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A flannel suit of gray, a panama<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gloves of tan. When winter came he wore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A double-breasted coat with lamb’s fur collar.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had no friends, so far as one could see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No membership in clubs, was never seen<br /></span>

<h2><a name="CATO_BRADEN" id="CATO_BRADEN"></a>CATO BRADEN</h2>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I went to Winston Prairie to attend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The funeral of Cato Braden. He<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had died at fifty-one and I had known him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since he was twenty-four, but for fifteen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Years or more I had not seen him, nor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exchanged with him more than a telegraphic<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Note about some trivial thing. Indeed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I had not been in Winston Prairie during<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These fifteen years.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">But on the train I thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Cato Braden, brought back all the days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through which I knew him, from the very first<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he returned to Winston Prairie from<br /></span>
<span class="i0">De Pauw, or was it Valparaiso? Yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Twas called a university I remember.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when I knew him first he kept at hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">De Senectute, also Anthon’s Homer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lexicons in Latin and in Greek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both unabridged. Sometimes he let me read<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The orations he had won the prizes with.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sometimes he would tell me what it meant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To study at a university.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what they did and what the boys were like.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_107" id="page_107">[107]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">This Cato Braden was a happy soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At twenty-four, of a full noble brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A gentle smiling mouth, an honest eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tall and handsome figure, altogether<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A man conspicuous for form, a bearing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of grace and courtliness, engaging ways;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He might be called most lovable, he had<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gift of friendship, was not envious,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could scarcely be enraged, was not offended<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By little things and often not by great.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had in short a nature fit to work<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With great capacity; had he combined<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An intellect but half his nature’s worth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He might have won the race. But many thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He promised much, his father most of all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because he had these virtues, and in truth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before his leaves unfolded with the spring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His mind seemed apt, perhaps seemed measured full<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of quality, the prizes he had won<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Valparaiso pointed to the fruit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He would produce at last.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">So on the train<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thought of Cato Braden. Then I thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of when he came from school with his degree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for that summer when he walked the square,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was whispered of as “Cato Braden, look.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first thing Winston Prairie knew it saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_108" id="page_108">[108]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His name conjoined with that of Jerry Ott’s&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was Ott and Braden, editors and owners,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Winston Prairie Eagle. Jerry Ott<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was sixty-nine and wheezy from the fight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Jefferson Democracy, free trade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besides the capital that Cato Braden<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought through his father to the enterprise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meant bitter war on enemies of truth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Cato Braden’s father had some wealth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made from the making of a vermifuge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a preposterous compound which he called<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pesodorne; and I have always thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Cato Braden’s father garrisoned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His factory for making patent nostrums<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By buying for his son this interest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And place of power in journalism; for<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The father’s strong devotion to the church<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did not protect him ’gainst the casual sneers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Winston Prairie’s paper called the Lance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which used to print such things as this, to instance:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“There’s Braden’s Vermifuge, well, Doctor Braden,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Try your own vermifuge, let’s see it work.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Well, anyway I know that Cato Braden<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Intended to pursue a legal course,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And practice the profession in a city.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know his father bought for him this place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Jerry Ott as editor of the Eagle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_109" id="page_109">[109]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know he went to work. I know he changed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The paper’s motto from “Hew to the line,”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To <i>Principia non homines</i>. I know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He used to sing “Over the Garden Wall,”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While writing editorials and smoked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A number of cheroots. I know he had<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A locked drawer where he kept a secret bottle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From which he’d take a drink at noon or night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know he was on terms of friendship with<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The milliner and dressmaker in a month<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After he came from Valparaiso. Yes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know he advocated a gymnasium,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dancing hall for Winston Prairie, and<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He opened up a fight to get a park<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where concerts might be given. Cato Braden<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had these ideas at least. About this park<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A word remains to say.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">Fernando Winston,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who founded Winston Prairie and surveyed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The original town, laid out a square along<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The river for a pleasure ground; in time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some fifty years or more, it was forgotten.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when this Cato Braden came to town<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And started as a journalist ’twas used<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In part by Winston Prairie’s creamery;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In part ’twas used for gardening by the pastor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Winston Prairie’s strongest church. But Cato<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_110" id="page_110">[110]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had searched the records, found them straight, began<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To agitate the park. And it was this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Together with <i>Principia non homines</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Free trade, the dressmaker and milliner,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps the bottle in the drawer, whose secret<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaked out at once, that clove the people of<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The town into two groups of friends and foes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had but just begun his editorship<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I left Winston Prairie; after that<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knew little of it, saw him but at times,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long separated, saw him not at all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For fifteen years before his death, and now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because I was his friend was on the train<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His funeral to attend.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">I drove to Oakland<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Dr. Green and William Smoot the grocer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Twas hot without a breeze, the town was still.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The church bell tolled until we reached the grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was the church whose pastor used the square<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For gardening. And on the way I asked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why Cato Braden died at fifty-one.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Why, whisky,” answered William Smoot, the grocer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“And women,” for he had bad luck they say.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“How is that, Doc, you know?”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">And Dr. Green<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After a silence said: “It isn’t true.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_111" id="page_111">[111]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">“He was as sound, so far as that’s concerned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“As any of us.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">Then I asked again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why Cato Braden died at fifty-one.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Dr. Green said laughing, “Well, you know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“They die at thirty-one and forty-one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“And sixty-one of what killed Cato Braden,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“That’s Bright’s Disease.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">“And whisky brings that on&mdash;”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I ventured to assert.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">“Sometimes” replied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The man of medicine, “But other things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Produce it. There’s a man’s diathesis;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“There’s worry, over-work, sometimes disease<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Suffered in childhood, leaving an effect<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Like soil, all fertilized for such seed as this.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“He should have drunk no whisky, yet he drank<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Not half so much as Winston Prairie thought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“But you can see if whisky caused this thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“All whisky drinkers would be sure to have it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Or die of it if not killed by a train.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We left the carriage, having reached the place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Cato Braden’s grave was dug, and stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Together in a company of fifty<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heard the pastor pray for heaven’s lessons<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_112" id="page_112">[112]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Cato Braden’s life. And after that<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We separated, made the horses trot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To reach our different destinations. I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looked up Will Boyden for a little talk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before my train left for the city.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">Will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was in his office with his sleeves rolled up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cob-pipe in mouth, typing a legal paper,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A narratio in slander, so he said.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He smiled from ear to ear and dropped his work.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“You’re here for Cato’s funeral,” he said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And added, “It’s a shame he had to die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Damned if it isn’t.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">Then I asked again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why Cato Braden died at fifty-one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Will said: “Winston Prairie, Illinois,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Killed Cato Braden.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">“Tell me what you mean?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Will refreshed his pipe and talked to me:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“I’m fifty-two and good for twenty years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have no stronger frame than Cato Braden,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But then I got a formula for life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As time went on, and it was one that suited<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My nature, and I thrived as you can see.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have the power to draw the nutriment<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of this soil, and I get strength thereby<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_113" id="page_113">[113]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherewith to overcome the things that kill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I work, but then I play, I hunt and fish,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I read and sometimes take a little trip.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I don’t drink whisky, not because I fear it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I hate putting in myself such fire&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beer and light wines are pleasant, more like food<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than stimulants. Well, Cato Braden started<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When ‘Over the Garden Wall’ was all the rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘All Coons Look Alike to Me’ was my<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Key-note for starting. You know what I mean:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between my day and his there’s just the difference<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That lies between waltz time and syncopation;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between the magic lantern and the movie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rattan phaeton and Ford machine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These new things came along before he died,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he had made his life for the old things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could not adjust himself, De Senectute<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Valparaiso had not taught him how<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To reach out in the world from Winston Prairie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And get the new things for his life. But if<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They taught him how he lost the secret here.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For after all a place like Winston Prairie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will kill your spirit just as surely as<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Island where they cooped up great Napoleon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the first place what is a man to do<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With life in any place? That is the problem.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what could Cato Braden do with life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Winston Prairie? First he was as fitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_114" id="page_114">[114]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be a journalist as I, and if<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Endowed to be a journalist, just think<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of editing The Eagle. But you see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His father was at war then with the Lance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over that vermifuge and pesodorne.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And under guise of starting him in life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bought Cato in the paper for the selfish<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Purpose of defending vermifuge.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Cato did it too, and put away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From year to year his dream of studying<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The law and practicing in a city.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">During which time the poisons of this town<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crept in his blood and stupefied and killed him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He married Mary Comfort, as you know.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Mary is&mdash;well, what I call a brood-mare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Although they had no children. What I mean<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She is a well-fleshed woman, sound of nerve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A help-eat, but she made a loyal wife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who had two eyes to see what Cato saw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never an eye to help him see the things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That lay around him, which he stumbled over.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And marriage to my mind means this to man:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He drains his body out to be a father,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drains his spirit out to be a husband,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unless the woman helps him see or feel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More than he sees or feels for self. Well then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The years went on. And every day at eight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He could be seen toward his office bent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_115" id="page_115">[115]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">At half past ten just as the morning train<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was whistling for the crossing he would go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To get the mail. Returning he would walk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along Main Street, slapping the folded News<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against his leg. He scanned it in his office.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At twelve o’clock he went to dinner, then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As whisky made him eat, he over-ate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And took a nap till two o’clock. At three<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One might discover him at solitaire&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had clipped from the morning paper quite enough<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To keep the boys in copy. Then at four<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He might be sitting at the livery stable,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or sometimes might be found in that back room<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Little’s restaurant, where a keg of beer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shipped in was being tapped. At night perhaps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He might be seen down there on Locust street,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waiting to enter where the milliner lived.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So passed his life away from twenty-four<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fifty-one. It’s simple enough to ask<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why not write for the Eagle, make it better,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give ideas to the people, help the town,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Refresh the mind, read, study history,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">De Senectute? Fancy Teddy Roosevelt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who’s labored for this land with restless gifts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tied down in Winston Prairie&mdash;well, you can’t,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He’d break the ties, and that’s the point, you see.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Cato couldn’t break them, had to stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Incapable to extract the good that’s here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_116" id="page_116">[116]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Susceptible to all the bad that’s here;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was a nose half active<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who enters in a room where gas escapes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sits in the room unconscious of the gas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till he grows sluggish, lies him down to rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dies unknowing. So I say it’s true<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Winston Prairie ruined Cato Braden<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And killed him in the end.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">You must go see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before you leave, our park called Willard Park,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Named after Emma Willard, that devout<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old woman, dead these fifteen years or so.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She left enough to build a granite coping,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Set out some trees, and buy park seats, a stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereon to carve the words, ‘The gracious gift<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Emma Willard.’ Well, this Cato Braden<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First talked this park, was first to tell the truth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About this plot of ground. And more than that<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Cato Braden came here he had dreams:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He wrote at first that boxing, wrestling, racing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would help this town; that games were needed here;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Americans seemed ignorant of the art<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of being gay, feeling light-hearted, wise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To play; that they were wise to work and pray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fear happiness. And Cato Braden said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The little town was cursed by just these things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many human souls destroyed by them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_117" id="page_117">[117]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">These were not thoughts of his, he found them somewhere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But knew them when he found them, that’s his credit.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What though he was a drunk man whom you ask<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What road to take, who points and gurgles guttural<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sounds inarticulate? Or better still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What though he was a sick man who in vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Attempts to make his household orders clear?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For it was true that Cato Braden spoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About these things at first, then gave them up.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For no one seemed responsive to his plans.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some there were who sneered, and others said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He’d better help the church, and leave alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The questions which make bitterness and strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which was their way of speaking of the square<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which Cato tried to make into a park.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They say a lung will turn to stone or steel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When men work in the filings and the dust.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last the dust of Winston Prairie turned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His soul to dust.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">You see old Jerry Ott<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had left a son his interest in the Eagle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Cato Braden died right at his table<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While playing solitaire. This son came in<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And found him dead, a card clutched in his hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The card was, strange enough, the deuce of clubs!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This son was glad that Cato Braden died<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For now he runs the Eagle by himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_118" id="page_118">[118]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">This Cato Braden had three strains of thought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I never met him lately but he talked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some one of them, at times all three of them.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One was the American town must be improved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So better to conserve the souls and bodies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of boys and girls. And even when the movie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And other things of this day came along<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He still maintained they did not meet the case.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He never said what thing was requisite.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in a general way I think he meant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A stronger, and more truthful and more natural<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Outlook and attitude would save a town<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From dust, and mold and death. For once he said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“This winter I shall read Grote’s History.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He never read it. But I think he meant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He would find out the secret of the Greeks.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then he’d say the young, the middle aged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old made separate spheres of feeling, thought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that a town should not be ruled by one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should not be governed as all folks were old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or young, or middle aged, but each should have<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The town for his according to his age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thought and vital power, within his sphere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And period of life; these separate spheres<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should move untroubled by the others, move<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Free, independent of the other spheres.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I talked with Cato Braden for the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_119" id="page_119">[119]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A week ago last night. He said to me:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wake these mornings lately with the thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another chance will come to me, that death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will bring another chance. And then he said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is the way of it. When you are young<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You say in five years I shall take a trip,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See New York City, go abroad perhaps.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When five years pass you do not take the trip.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then you say in a year I’ll take the trip.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so it goes, while you say in a year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next year, next year, until at last you say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No, never now! Well, now you’d think a man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would weep when he stands up against the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And knows he cannot climb the wall. But no,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Something still whispers you will do it yet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then you know it must be after death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In life again, the chance will come to you.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For you know well it is not in this life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Cato Braden said: Not in this life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall I read Grote, I could not understand it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After these years in Winston Prairie&mdash;still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have a feeling I shall know about it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Somewhere, somehow.<br /></span>
<span class="i10">You’d better catch your train.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It’s good to see you. Up there in the city<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Think sometimes of the American village and<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What may be done for conservation of<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The souls of men and women in the village.”<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of what you say, I’ve wondered what’s the matter.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I write and write for statements of my taxes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cannot get them. Then I take the train,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Your property was sold, I am informed.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Elapses and I get a letter&mdash;hum!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Winston Prairie&mdash;office of the controller;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your property was sold for special numbered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two thousand and eighty-six, when you reply<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Please mention sale 1019.&mdash;Damn these thieves!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I pay that. I see! your court-house ring,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The men who’re sworn to enforce the law are those<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who break it, and who use it to despoil you&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, let me tell you.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">In this very June<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I went to Winston Prairie on this errand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And after I had written several times<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To get a statement. I arrived at noon&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet the court-house offices were closed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The treasurer’s, the clerk’s, controller’s, all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I met a janitor who said: All closed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till half past one. That meant I’d miss my train<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back to Chicago, and would have to stay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Winston Prairie until six o’clock.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sat down in the hall-way with a curse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in a minute there were hideous yells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shrieks, curses, as it were of women beaten,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tortured, or strangled. So I went to see,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_122" id="page_122">[122]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And found a door behind which I could hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Intolerable tears, the scratching of weak hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the door and wall. What is the matter?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hallooed through the door. O, go to hell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A woman said, you know what is the matter.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I don’t, I said, I’ll help you if I can.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then followed sobs and wails, and incoherent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blubbering of words. At last I saw a finger<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stuck through the broken plaster by the door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leaning down I said: look through at me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then I stooped and looking through the crack<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saw a gray eye, which looked as it might be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Slavic birth. But who can read an eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shown singly through a crack? So while I talked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To get the story of these girls in prison,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(For where they were was called the calaboose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Built in the court-house) some one back of me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said: They’ll be quiet in due time, the cooler<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cools people off. I turned and saw a man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who seemed to be a judge, and was a judge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I discovered later. Well, I said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I cannot bear to see a human being<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In such distress and terror&mdash;what’s their ages?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One’s sixteen and one’s seventeen, said the judge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But they are bad ones, so I made the fine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enough to hold them thirty days. I asked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What did they do? They were soliciting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The judge replied, and here in Winston Prairie<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_123" id="page_123">[123]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The law is law and we enforce the law.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We do not do as you do in Chicago.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I felt my heart shut tight its valves and stop,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And was about to say: You are a fool.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You are what some would have America,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You are an Illinoisan, damn your soul.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You are a figure in the court-house ring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereof the tax shark is a figure too.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But then I thought these girls might prove to be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Worth while some time. But even if they live<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Street walkers all their lives, they stone no prophets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Devour no widows’ houses, do less harm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than court-house rings and judges in the rings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So this is what I said: May I enquire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What are your Honor’s hours for holding court?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he replied: Court has adjourned till two.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hold till six o’clock, we do not loaf<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As judges in Chicago do, good-day!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Well, then at half past one I paid my taxes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With interest, penalties and all the costs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At two o’clock I stood before the bar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the judge addressed these words: Your Honor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I represent Miss Christine Leichentritt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Miss Garda Gerstenburg, who are in jail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under your Honor’s sentence. I have seen<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To let them go, if all the costs are paid.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_124" id="page_124">[124]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I went to see him on a matter of taxes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this came up. The state’s attorney rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said: Your Honor, they are very young,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And though they have been caught before at this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And warned that Winston Prairie is no place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For them to ply their trade, I am inclined<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To think they will not break our laws again.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I thought I saw his honor’s eye light up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if it caught a wireless, so he said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“The court is satisfied.” I paid the costs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And took Christine and Garda to Chicago.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But at the station, as I said good bye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Christine flared up: You don’t suppose that I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will let you pay those costs, I am not cheap.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I may be bad, but I am square, she said.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I have money in my room, come on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Twelfth and Wabash and I’ll pay you back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For me and Garda.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">No, I said, go on.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Try to be good, but if you can’t be good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be wise, and do not go to Winston Prairie.<br /></span>

<h2><a name="WILL_BOYDEN_LECTURES" id="WILL_BOYDEN_LECTURES"></a>WILL BOYDEN LECTURES</h2>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Sunday after Cato Braden died<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will Boyden lectured in the Masons’ Hall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the theme, “Was Jesus Really Great?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At first he pointed out that Jesus knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No history except that of the Jews.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if he’d heard of Athens never spoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A word about it, never read a line<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Homer, Sophocles, or Aristotle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or Plato, or of Virgil, never a word<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Concerning Egypt’s wisdom, or of India’s.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then he dropped this point with the remark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That one could know one’s people’s history<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that alone, and still be great, perhaps.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But still he thought it was unfortunate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Jesus gave the Hebrews such a lift<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that to-day they rule the Occident<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Athens should have ruled, if only Time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had given her the right dramatic touch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To catch the populace.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">He then declared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Jesus was a poet, but he said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“What are his figures? Never a word of stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never a word of oceans, nor of mountains<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_126" id="page_126">[126]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save Olivet or Zion, so you see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His limitations as to imagery.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then have you noted how his sombre soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Picked blasted fig-trees, tares, the leprous poor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sepulchres and sewers, dirty cups,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherewith to make interpretations, yes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He spoke of lilies, too. Well, so have I.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet you people call me pessimist<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because I’ve tried to rescue Winston Prairie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And have not shrunk from charging Winston Prairie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Cato Braden’s death. The difference<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between the Man of Galilee and me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is this: He wanted to fulfill the law<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Moses and Isaiah, make Jerusalem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which was a Winston Prairie in a way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Hebrew citadel to rule the world.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I, if I could have my way, would make<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Winston Prairie Athens.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">Then he said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“I have four thoughts to-day to touch upon.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The Sunday after Cato Braden died<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will Boyden lectured in the Masons’ Hall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the theme, “Was Jesus Really Great?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At first he pointed out that Jesus knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No history except that of the Jews.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if he’d heard of Athens never spoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A word about it, never read a line<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Homer, Sophocles, or Aristotle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or Plato, or of Virgil, never a word<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Concerning Egypt’s wisdom, or of India’s.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then he dropped this point with the remark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That one could know one’s people’s history<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that alone, and still be great, perhaps.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But still he thought it was unfortunate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Jesus gave the Hebrews such a lift<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that to-day they rule the Occident<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Athens should have ruled, if only Time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had given her the right dramatic touch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To catch the populace.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">He then declared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Jesus was a poet, but he said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“What are his figures? Never a word of stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never a word of oceans, nor of mountains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save Olivet or Zion, so you see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His limitations as to imagery.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then have you noted how his sombre soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Picked blasted fig-trees, tares, the leprous poor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sepulchres and sewers, dirty cups,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherewith to make interpretations, yes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He spoke of lilies, too. Well, so have I.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet you people call me pessimist<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because I’ve tried to rescue Winston Prairie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And have not shrunk from charging Winston Prairie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Cato Braden’s death. The difference<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between the Man of Galilee and me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is this: He wanted to fulfill the law<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Moses and Isaiah, make Jerusalem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which was a Winston Prairie in a way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Hebrew citadel to rule the world.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I, if I could have my way, would make<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Winston Prairie Athens.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">Then he said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“I have four thoughts to-day to touch upon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first one is concerning hogs&mdash;you start:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, look at Matthew chapter eight and find<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The Winston Prairie devils which destroyed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor Cato Braden.<br /></span>
<span class="i10">“My next thought is found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Matthew chapter nine; and it is this;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Jesus saw the multitude all fainting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And scattered abroad as sheep without a shepherd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His soul was stirred&mdash;that is a way with genius,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether it be your Altgeld, Pericles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or yet your artist soul like Heinrich Heine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But think of this: If you would lead and save<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The multitude, assuming that can be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall you accomplish it by rules and laws<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Applied externally, which is the way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ecclesiastic powers pursue and find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Divine authority in Jesus for it?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or shall you teach the way of opening up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soul of man to sun-light, letting in<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Power which is around us, in the which<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We live and move, and so give chance for growth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To what is in us? For your shepherd drives.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No, Jesus hit it better when he spoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of leaven than of shepherds.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">“So if one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Find leaven and would give it, let there be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A few to watch the final hour with him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he would be delivered from the cup,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But knows it cannot be, that to refuse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cup is to deny the inexorable law.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“So now I come to what is chiefest here:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Destroy this temple and I will re-build it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In three days. Now you know what preachers say:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This means the resurrection&mdash;not at all!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These were the greatest words that Jesus said.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here his genius seized its fullest power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here was it that he hid Jerusalem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under his hands as if it were a toy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tossed the world up as it were a ball.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, what are temples, cities, cultures, ages<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of beauty, glory, but the work of genius?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What earth and stone and flesh but plastic stuff<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Responsive to the touch of prophet hands?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What Winston Prairie, what America<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all this turbulence of bobbing heads<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In fields and markets, temples, halls across<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This continent of sovereign states but puppets<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which may be changed in flesh, in deepest spirit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made more erect, heroic, God-like, wise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By genius’ hands, not revolutionists’,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor shepherds’. So destroy America,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But not by picks and axes, let it be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As in the movies where a lovelier face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Steals in and blots with brighter light a face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which must fade out to let the lovelier face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Complete the story.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Now in a moment’s silence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let’s pray for Cato Braden.”<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Before I knew my garden or awoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To its banality I set an oak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At one end for a life-long husbandry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A white syringa and a lilac tree,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Pallas Athena in an hour of ease<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From guarding states and succoring the wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pressed wistfully her lips against a flute<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made by a Phrygian youth from resonant wood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cut near Sangarius. Upon a bank<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made sweet by daisies and anemone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She sat with godly wisdom exercised<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blowing her breath against the stubborn tube<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That it might answer and vibrate in song.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But while she played, down-looking, she beheld<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A serpent’s eyes, which by the water’s edge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay coiled among the reeds, as if aware<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the divinity that filled the place.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Athena saw her image in the cove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where like a silver mirror, motionless<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sangarius lay, and seeing her own face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus suddenly, was stricken with surprise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of her fair forehead wrinkled, and her lips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pursed and distorted as she strove to curb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The resisting instrument. So with a smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little laugh, which brought her beauty back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gilded like a gradual burst of sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The water where the charmed serpent lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_155" id="page_155">[155]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifting his head up to the living warmth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She threw the flute down, and Olympus way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vanished, from sight.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">Marsyas all the while<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath an oak’s shade by the water’s edge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had drowsed voluptuously, and heard the notes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dreaming some shepherd youth who watched his sheep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon a near-by hill which to the swale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sloped in luxuriance, upon a reed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His idle fancies loosened from the stops.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when Athena passed him, since he heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A roar of wings, as when a flock of quail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up-fly the hunter’s step, he woke to find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The forest silent and the music gone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then straying toward the rushes, he espied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flute upon the golden sands, and took it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tried his lips upon it, where the lips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Pallas Athena left it fragrant, moist,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with a soul, which to the artless breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the rude Satyr gave melodious speech.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So thinking that the music was his own<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that the flute was but a worthless wood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save that it made his genius manifest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And swollen with conceit Marsyas sent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A word of challenge to the Delphic god,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Apollo of the cithara, for trial<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of skill in music, saying who should prove<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_156" id="page_156">[156]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The victor might do with the other what<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pleased him to do, and let the Muses judge.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But when Athena heard Apollo laugh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the nine Muses gossiped of the dare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which Marsyas uttered, for the lower meadows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of flowered Olympus whispered of the thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In jest and quip, and knowing that her soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still echoed in the flute, but would anon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fade from it as the perfume from a girdle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tinct by the touch of Aphrodite’s hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spoke to Apollo: “Grant a little time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherein the Satyr may improve his skill.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To which the Muses nodded ’mid their smiles.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But yet Apollo gave assent, though teased<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By reason of their chatter and the thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hid in Athena’s word that any respite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Granted the Satyr could prosper his success.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Meanwhile Marsyas waited for the day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Appointed of Apollo. Near Sangarius<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And through the woodlands tireless with the flute:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes in imitative harmony<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mocking the sound of fluttering leaves, and now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The musical winds that blow in early spring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around a peak of dancing asphodel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the sea warms them, and at other times<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The little waves that patter on the sands<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_157" id="page_157">[157]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of old Sangarius rich in numerous flags.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And once he strove with music’s alchemy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To turn to sound the sunlight of the morn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which fills the senses as illuminate dew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quickens the ovule of the tiger-flower.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again he sang the sorrow of his youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When a wild nymph after one day of bliss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fled him while sleeping. And again he beat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rhythm lying at the root of life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which marks the whirling planets. And Apollo<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hearing betimes a note of purest tone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fall like a star, betrayed his wonderment&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereat the muses vexed him with their smiles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whisperings to each other. But Apollo<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could sense the Satyr’s waning skill, which dulled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With its employment, as Athena’s soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Died from the flute, although the Satyr knew not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each day of waiting doomed him:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">Then at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The day dawned for the trial of their skill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Marsyas came bearing the hollow flute&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all had left it of Athena’s soul.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then on Sangarius’ wooded banks the muses<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To judge assembled, fair, majestical.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With arms entwined some close together stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some half-reclined upon the flowery grass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all bore in their eyes the light of mirth<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_158" id="page_158">[158]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suppressed, half-hidden. Then, for that Euterpe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was mistress of the flute, since it was deemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair to the Satyr that the contest be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Judged by the flute, gave signal to begin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereat Apollo struck the cithara<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To test the strings, and all the wood was hushed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Awed by the magic of its harmony.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when Marsyas blew upon the flute<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fear coursed through him as his wonder rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether Apollo had bewitched its soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To such discordance, or its utterance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such as he knew it, when compared with the god’s<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was so unmusical. Yet he dare not fail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The contest, so they waged it to the end,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the sweet muses now grown pitiful<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No longer smiled, but turned their heads away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sorrow for Marsyas, for his shame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for the fate to follow.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">So at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With one accord the muses rose and looked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With eyes significant upon Apollo,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who angered by the Satyr’s swollen pride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And monstrous failure, had become a will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of resolute retribution. But the muses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because they feel for those who trying lose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even as a mother for her crippled son<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom the sound-footed distance in the race,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_159" id="page_159">[159]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hastened away lest they behold the thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That came to pass. And flinging far the flute<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Marsyas shrieked and sank upon the earth.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Whereat Apollo seized his wretched form<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lifting him up, with strips of laurel bark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound the poor Satyr to a rugged oak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flayed him alive, and took the Satyr’s skin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hung it in a cave, and turned his blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To water, whence the river Marsyas<br /></span>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Zeus envied Æsculapius that he healed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sick and brought the dead to life, and fain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would slay him. So the Cyclops brought Zeus lightning<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With which Zeus smote the healer. Then Apollo<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Destroyed the Cyclops, grieving for his son.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Clotho laughed to see the thread of fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slip by Atropos, woven in the cloth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of destiny. For had she cut the thread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shot from the spindle, then a little trace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of scarlet, but no figures of despair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had marked the storied tapestry. So Apollo<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was doomed for punishment to tend the flocks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of King Admetus, lord of Pheræ. Next<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Apollo met a mortal woman, daughter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of an old soldier, servitor of the gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rich in land.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">He, sitting on a rock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That overlooked a green Thessalian field<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where grazed the flocks, clad in a leopard’s skin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His crook beside him, dreamed of wide Olympus:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“This hour the muses dance, the Council sits<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there is high debate, or Hera storms<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_169" id="page_169">[169]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Zeus’ absence; there is life, and I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unknown, alone, a shepherd by this field<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of pastoral pathos labor all the day.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then a step disturbed his revery;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And looking up he saw a slender maid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White as gardenias, jonquil-haired, with eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As blue as Peneus when he meets the sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And an old weakness crept upon the god.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ever in his soul there shone the face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of woman, like the face of Artemis,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His virgin sister, delicate and chaste;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to o’ercome such whiteness and reserve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had been Apollo’s madness from his birth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this Chione, daughter of the soldier,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Servitor of the gods and rich in land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once became his passion. So he rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to Chione spoke, and she, to him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then anon she saw the unkept curls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sun-bleached, that touched his shoulders, then his breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smooth as her own, and then his arms, his hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His shapely knees, his firm and pointed feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her eyes closed as stars beneath the dawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dawn rose in her cheeks. And the god knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her inmost thought.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">So all that day they played,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the wind-blown light of Thessaly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_170" id="page_170">[170]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">He wove her traps for crickets from the grass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the willow branches made her flutes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He caught her butterflies, and sang her runes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of living things, and how the earth and sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Erebus and Love sprang into being;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how the sun, and the bright pageant of the stars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dance joyously to music. And Chione<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was dumb for happiness; and the day went by.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But with the dusk there came a swooning languor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All was forgotten save the shepherd’s face<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The circled splendor of the sickle moon&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor eyes, nor lips, only a golden blur.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rousing she beheld the enshadowed field<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flockless and silent, and the shepherd gone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then through the night Chione weakly walked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And found at last her home.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">The light of day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought terror to Chione. Then she sought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And found Apollo where he sat before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And told him that her father, the old soldier,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was favored of Admetus, and would bring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The royal power against him, if he failed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The troth of wedlock. And Apollo mused<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon his exile from Olympus’ throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Zeus’ wrath against him, that he slew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Cyclops, and upon his shepherd state<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_171" id="page_171">[171]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tending Admetus’ flocks, and how unknown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And weak he stood between these kingly hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Zeus and of Admetus. And seeing her fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More fair in tears, he gave her his consent.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Next day Chione brought the god a robe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sandals and a girdle. Thus arrayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chione took him to her father’s home<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ancient soldier, servitor of the gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rich in land, and spoke of him as Acteus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A merchant from the city. Then the father<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave thanks to Zeus and at the family board<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Apollo supped, as one who would become<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chione’s husband. So it came to pass.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They walked together in the bridal train<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behind the perfumed torches.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">All the while<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Zeus smiled to see Apollo’s punishment.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Hera, who with woman’s subtlety,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knew that there shone within Apollo’s soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A face like to the face of Artemis,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His virgin sister, delicate and chaste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to o’ercome such whiteness and reserve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had been Apollo’s madness from his birth,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With wrinkles and a touch of whitened hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a lack-lustre eye, which all the art<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Could scarce remove.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">Then Chione told her father<br /></span>

<span class="i0">You wonder why I bought so many houses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bought and repaired, built over home on house.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first one was to make a home for Mary,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Frank and Bessie, for I had myself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A settled home when I was boy and man,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Habitation for a boy who’s growing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first house, then, was poor enough, God knows!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A sick man breathes into the very paper.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Some apple trees half-rotted, covered over<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With water sprouts stood in a yard of weeds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A barn was at the yard’s end out of shape<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From leaning at an angle. All in all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The place was haunted, but it was the best<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A few years past, it seemed scarce two or three,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The haunted house, and built a handsome barn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cut out the apple trees, destroyed the weeds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And put an iron fence around the yard.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Put bathrooms, running water in the house.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Why did you wait until the children left?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of course she knew, but blamed me just the same.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so we had no pleasure with this house.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She wanted larger rooms, and trees in front,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sunny dining room&mdash;there was that porch<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Brick walks about the yard with plots of flowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A barn of brick&mdash;it was the very place!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The house would hold a family of ten!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besides the upper rooms were far too small:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What is a dining room, or huge drawing room<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Were sick year in and out&mdash;that’s why they sold it<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Well, Mary came that summer with her children,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">She joined with me in picking out the house,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">This is the place at last. But then I thought<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And when she came she kissed me, she was glad,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the train rushed on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bringing me nearer to you.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Why the man I loved at first and hated afterward<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had died that tragic death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaving me with memories of that love,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The world turned on me when I fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the little power I had departed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And why in spite of my aspiration<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I had run into such disgust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such overthrow of my work,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such undoing of myself,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And to think of what had done it:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My search for love, my struggle for excellence&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These things alone!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I had married this second man for love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And because I believed in him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a man of power, a man of thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A man who loved me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hoping through him to retrieve my life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the smut of the man I married first.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I found my very soul deceived:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was just a violent visionary,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A frothing fool,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A spendthrift, coward, hedonist.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there I was tied to him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And carrying his child while finding him out.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I used to stand with my face to the wall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And choke my mouth with a handkerchief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To keep from crying out.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I knew if a whimper passed my lips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I should fall and roll on the floor with madness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And beat my head on the floor.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So when the train rolled into the station<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sickness, a weakness came over me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I had spent myself in expectation.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now that I was about to see you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thought of the vainness of seeing you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the thought that you could not help me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_202" id="page_202">[202]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though I had traveled these thousand miles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made me wish to fly, to hide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I stepped from the train in a kind of daze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And scarcely felt your kiss.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It seemed relaxed, so faint.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And your voice was weak.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And your eyes were dim and dry.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And there in the cab as we drove to the Park<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I was still in a daze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Talking of May baskets<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blindman’s buff,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And laughing, for one always laughs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the moment is worst.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so it was I did not really see you.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when we began to walk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Things about you began to limn themselves:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your shoulders seemed a little bent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There were streaks of snow on your temples.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you were quiet with the terrible quietness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of understanding of life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the old wit I knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the glad defiance of fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the light in your eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the musical laugh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All were gone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps the daily grind of Cap and Bells<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had sapped you, dear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_203" id="page_203">[203]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when I looked at your hand on your cane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saw how white and slim it was,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how it trembled, I knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You were not the giant man of old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though you said you were gaining strength again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I could lean on your arm.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Well, then I told you all:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How my search for love had fooled me again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how this beast had wronged and robbed me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how he stood in his paranoiac rages,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And compared himself to Christ.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when I began to speak of the child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What a darling girl she was,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You sank in a seat and said: “No more&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I didn’t think I was weak as this&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You mustn’t tell me another thing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not now, not just now.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then I saw, what Time had done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I saw that you could not help me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the next day and the next day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I did not see you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And weeks passed by and I scarcely saw you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I scarcely saw you again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though I had come a thousand miles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lean on your arm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It grew in my mind that you despised me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or that you were indifferent to my lot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_204" id="page_204">[204]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or at least that I was a wounded thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You could not bear to see.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till at last, though I knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That my way was clear: there was nothing to do<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But to fly with my child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leave him forever,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And endure great loneliness forever, if need be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whatever shame there was,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the sake of my soul’s honor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which only myself could save,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Though I knew, I say, that my way was clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I needed your help not at all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still in a kind of madness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I began to reproach you for not helping me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for abandoning me to my fate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a sick child will cry and blame its mother<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When it is not healed at once.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Plunged up to the mouth in spiritual muck,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what life is left for me now?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How can I go on with life?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To the archangels and the fiery seed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mad Prometheus, fighting gods for men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heaven for earth, this greeting:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I led you once, I taught you, am the sire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of hosts of you, but fellow to you all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when I fell, was chained upon this bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By adamantine sickness, then I lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And had you in my thought hour after hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Day after day, and saw you in dreams by night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still fighting, bleeding, caring for the fallen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or objurgating heaven for the curse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It sheds on men, or arming for the fray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With steel of resisting thought; and so the sense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of my responsibility has weighed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon me as my night has deftly dawned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To something clearer than the soul you knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who led you once, with breath of iron horns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Called to you: Charge! there is the trench of greed!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Avenge the poor! bring justice! purge the state<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of fraud! And so I lay and thought of you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still guarding the old lines, fighting the old fights,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While I was changed, was not your leader now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cared no more for your battles, save as strife<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_212" id="page_212">[212]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That leads up higher, for upon my wall<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His freedom and existence who each day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conquers them newly. How can I tell you<br /></span>

<span class="i0">What you have seen has helped you to perceive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The final beauties, but is blurred in mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It has been lived, has lost its vital power,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">Climb a mountain<br /></span>

<span class="i0">You have forgot the valleys, save perhaps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The torment of the flies of which you’re freed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In these cool heights.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">So age cannot recall<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That made the thought of youth. A sickness comes:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Our yesterdays are chrysalises whence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We crawled to what we are. In short, archangels,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have become another soul. Now listen:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I have seen things I cannot tell you of.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have gained understandings past my power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To give you clearly; yet upon me rests<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The teasing call to tell you, here I lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Revolving this new task of leadership.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How shall I make you see I have not failed you?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not really played a treasonous soul to you?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not scorned the cause I gave you, kept you in?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or damned you for, or made you suffer for?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I railed at heaven, I instructed you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rail as well. How can you understand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I now accept the fate? Will you despise me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For saying this? Or will you say disease<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has weakened me, cooled off the fire of soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And damped my courage? Then go on your way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To find a worthier leader?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">So to doubt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I taught you once, but now my mind believes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to deny the order of the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I gave you words, now I affirm the plan.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fight against the gods in man’s behalf,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I made my leadership. Now I perceive<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_214" id="page_214">[214]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cause of gods and men made one. You see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is not individual gain that counts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In these external benefits of freedom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And satisfaction of material wants,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That counts so much, I say, as inner chains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Struck from the wrists, and inner scales peeled off<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From inner eyes. I grant the human cause,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And say this,&mdash;Can I make you understand?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To give you proof my heart is with you yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me reveal my sacrifice.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">Suppose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You’ve found a truth that others knew before you,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Who’s labored with you, tell him, “I’m convinced,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I see the cat at last.” You want to share<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your joy with some one, want his dragging hope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hear you have arrived. And so with me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hungered to communicate my vision<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To some one who had seen it, and who knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its meaning, what it meant to me.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">But then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You archangels and hot Promethean seed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each time I thought of making the confession<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In thought around my sick bed, with contempt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_215" id="page_215">[215]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or pained compassion written on your brows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And words like these: He has deserted us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He has surrendered, cringed before the gods.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so my sacrifice is this: You’ll be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first to know my second birth, you can<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In such case never charge it up to fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or weakness, shrunken nerves, or spirit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That lost the human touch through the effects<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of some delirium. What mind so clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or will so strong to die with this denial<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For your sakes? For it may be best for you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To live the rebel out of you. And if<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You thought&mdash;at least I fear it&mdash;if you thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I had gone over to the hosts you hate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As you are now, through weakness, made my peace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With heaven, as you’d call it, just to save<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My wretched self, you’d have a mad regret,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fine disgust to work through, added labor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To all you must achieve. That’s why I die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seal this message. Break it on the day<br /></span>

<span class="i0">You face me with a grave and haughty air,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Genius is love, is freedom, it must speak,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">No gray hairs then, they called me thirty-five,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">They hailed me as a genius, I had played<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Othello to their liking, was yet young<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Show her the way to greatness, might it be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A modest part could be assigned to her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I played mad Othello?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">I have found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That when a woman has no business with you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her calling speaks the oldest one of all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So true to this I acted. We commenced<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for three months I struggled for the prize.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her first play was to make me pity her.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She told me of her suffering, her youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(She was then thirty-five), her poverty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her labor to learn French. And like a man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I pitied her and opened up my purse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She said, “No! No! this hat and dress will do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It brushes well.” She would not take a cent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw her daily for a month before<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_252" id="page_252">[252]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I won her. Though she gave me hands and lips&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was a fury in her lips, my heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed like to stop&mdash;I could not win the prize.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One day she broke in tears: “You seemed so noble,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So great of mind, are you then like the rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who want a woman’s body, nothing else?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“I want your love,” I said, “your love for mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I love you, dearest!” faugh, must I repeat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gagging words? So I declared the love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I felt too deeply, and to prove my love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I added: “I’ll renounce the gift of love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My Lady Wonderful, worship you afar.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You would not have me tortured by your eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor have me see you often, in this case!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I had given love as I had given<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All wealth that I could pour of soul, achievement,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Name in the world, all pride, all thought of self<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Present or future to this woman, now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For love’s sake I renounced the gift of love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so I left her. Well, she called me back.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And though I was a fool, and blinded too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw her thought and won her in an hour.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So then commenced my madness, for she said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It could not be again. The blood I tasted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could not be drunk. “You love me,” she would say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Then bring me not to shame, it will be known<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If we go on. I cannot lose my bread.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Librarians cannot have their names in doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_253" id="page_253">[253]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who serve the public, as I do.” So it was<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The madness braced my will, and unrelenting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sought her, won her. In a little while<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We were adjusted to habitual love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I was happy save when I was mad.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For she knew younger men who came to call;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or take her to the theatre, with one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She corresponded. “Let it be,” she said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“I must not be in public with you, dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose name and greatness in the world would point<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To our relationship, how could it be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You would be with a woman without station,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As time went on. My name, what was it now?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My art, what was it now? She even hinted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could not act Othello. There was nothing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could do more to keep her, hold her love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her admiration. O how good esteem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seems to a man who forfeits it to her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose body he can have, who cannot have<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sympathy whereby a man is nerved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To daily work and living. What is Art?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No picture would be painted, poem sung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save for the thought that woman close at hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or somewhere in the world yet to be found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By reason of the picture or the poem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will see and love you for it.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">Let me say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In passing, and dismiss it, I began<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_255" id="page_255">[255]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With little sums until I gave her much.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There’s matter of more moment.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">I confess,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In spite of my licentious life, the creed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One sees among the artists, where I’ve lived,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To strong belief in woman’s virtue, yes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In spite of lip avowal of the faith<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of love called free, I have not quite believed it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But it was in her soul. She sucked that milk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A child upon her mother’s breast, she said&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It all came out at last from many talks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then, just then, I thought I saw foreshadowed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A social change upon the things of sex:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We read together Ann Veronica,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Bernard Shaw, and laughed and said, at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We see each other clearly. We have found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A footing for our life. I slept at last.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dragon vanished from my dreams. I waked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A song upon my lips, left drink alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could face my image in the looking-glass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And find restored a noble quality,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A strength and genius.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">But if love be free<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if you love though only for an hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why not the cup of love? Her former friend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Piqued to an interest by my love for her<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_256" id="page_256">[256]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came back to see if he had overlooked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A beauty he would have. Well, she confessed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their night together. It was at the time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My poor canzones which sang our stormy love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had just been finished. Every artist fool<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Writes sonnets or canzones once in his life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so I had to add a verse to tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her faithlessness&mdash;or was it faithlessness?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since she declared she loved me, did not love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This older friend. But if she did not love him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What was this act? She called it just a trial<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of our love which had stood the test, O God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such mazes for my soul!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">Flushed then with wrath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drink I beat her cruelly. She stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With scarce a cry of pain and let me strike,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said if I considered it was just<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To beat her so, she wished to bear the pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then with a cry I ceased. We fell asleep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stretched on the bed together. When we woke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She kissed me her forgiveness. I returned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The kiss, ah me!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">So now the story turns.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was a woman critic who pursued<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My work with hateful words. Before I knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cockatrice I found it best to fold<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_257" id="page_257">[257]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">This critic’s column under, never read.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in a day or two from that on which<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I beat my mistress, what should I behold?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A letter from her&mdash;she had left the town<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without my knowing, she was visiting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This critic enemy at her summer home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in this mail I found my poor canzones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Returned to me, and in the letter this:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“My friend says for some reason you would try<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To compromise me by this wretched verse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I return it to you, go and burn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shall not see you more&mdash;so she advises,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so I think. I wish you well no less.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You are a little old to rise to fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or excellence in acting, yet go on.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps there is not aught beside to do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it will occupy your mind, good-bye.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So shortly everywhere I seemed to sense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The feeling that they deemed me foul and base.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While we were friends I made her known to artists,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And writers in the city. With this start<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She had gone on and multiplied her friends<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among this folk. I saw it all at once<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As one sees dawn from darkness. Then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The social standard melted, gave away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To all that had been written for some years.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Free love had won at last. And we who kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_258" id="page_258">[258]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our love in hiding, she who lied to keep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her name as one who lived a maiden’s life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I who doubted, hated her because<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was not freshly mine, we, she and I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stepped to a world all new, she to enjoy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I to perish. I was weak from loss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of blood from wounds she gave me, spent for love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poured for her sorrow, for she grieved and wept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I was not her early love, her love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At love’s beginning. I went here and there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To build her life up, make it rich, repair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The injuries of her youth, retrieve the days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which had brought loneliness. Forbear with me&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thought I could tell all in just a word&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes, this is it&mdash;She learned what was my strength<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And took it for her own, found out my faults<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And struck me there. She gave me confidence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And trust, I fancied. On analysis<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She had concealed herself, there had not been<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clear understanding with us. So she took<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My friends, and friends are never wholly friends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made them hers, through these made other friends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Explored my havens, my alliances,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My secret powers of prestige in the world.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I awoke to find the world my foe!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every desk of every editor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silent for knowledge of me, breaking silence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In just a word of hate. You see she loosed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_259" id="page_259">[259]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">This story like a mist which creeps through cracks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I had compromised her. Then behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I who had helped to bring this era in<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sex equality, yes, in spite of all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My ingrained feelings I have spoken of,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Found myself robbed of her by just the creed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I had upheld, and saw her live with him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who was her friend, before I knew her, yes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And justified by those whom she had feared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because they hated me, and pitied him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound to a woman in a loveless life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who would not free him, let him marry her.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the last atom of my strength I summoned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To play Othello. It was death or life!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soul triumph or soul ruin. But you see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cockatrice had sent the word around<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sharpened every critic eye. I faced<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An audience of one mind, could sense it all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where hatred, mild amusement were well mixed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To poison, paralyze creative power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And even break my memory. But I said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Show now your genius, drink the hatred in<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till all your spirit sparkles as a star<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the north wind of winter blows at night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nothing opposes but a woman’s hate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rise on its wreckage. So I spurred myself.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And even when I saw her critic friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_260" id="page_260">[260]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Limned from the mass of faces, lost my clue<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I had not acted through the strangle scene<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I heard calls and bells, the curtain fell,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Out in the night we went&mdash;I knew not where&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was a night of drink, and I awoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To strange surroundings in a scented room,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A woman with light hair lay by my side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“How did I get here”&mdash;then the woman laughed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was a Fury, for the Furies had me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the house I ran, from place to place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All day went wandering in the city, thus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My wanderings of ten years began, they seem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ten centuries. What do you think of this?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">“Slow death to love! Exquisite rack!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah me! I had not made this fate&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The warp was stretched, the woof was spun,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Just then the Shadow near me stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who stepped aside for you. He took<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With unabated comradeship<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My hand in his. That closed our book.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">There were seven nights of the moon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This August, beloved.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There were nights before the seven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When we scarcely saw the moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or perhaps as we canoed, ere the sun sank,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We saw her as a transparent tissue of white<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against a sky as white.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when we first saw the moon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She had risen before the sun had sunk.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the next night she was brighter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the evening planet above her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Despite the tongues of fire in the west<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the sun had set on fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great coils of cloud!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then there were those nights between<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her growth and her o’erflowing fullness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When hand in hand we walked in your garden<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the Chinese balloons and coreopsis,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hibiscus, marigold, hydrangeas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the rose arches,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by the hedge of California privet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And looked at the lake,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_269" id="page_269">[269]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the moon in the sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the moon on the lake.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And do you remember what we saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As we stared at the wake of the moon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the lake?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ripples made blacknesses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the moon made silver splendors,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as we stared we saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the shadows of waves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Running into the light of the moon on the water<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Youths and maids and children<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Coming from darkness into the light in a dance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Joining hands, falling into embraces,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hurrying to evanishment at the path of light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the moon had paved the water.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shall never see the moon on the water<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without seeing these youths and maids and children,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And without thinking of that night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the full moon!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This was the night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We saw the moon rise, from the very first,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across the lake o’ertopping the forest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A spire of pine stood up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against a sky made pale as of the northern lights.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in a moment a bit of fire lit the spire of the pine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As it were a candle lighted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_270" id="page_270">[270]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she rose so fast that I took my watch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To time the rising of the moon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Free and clear of the spire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she rose so fast that as we gazed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She cleared the spire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soared with such silent glory above the forest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sailed to the southwest of the spire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at that moment the whippoorwills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Began to sing in the woodlands near&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We had not heard them before in all this summer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we stood in the loggia<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the silence of our own thoughts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the silence of the full moon!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And it was then that the pressure of your hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave me a meaning of sorrow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was then that the pressure of your hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spoke, as flame which turns in the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a change in your heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if not a change, of another’s heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toward whom you turned.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And I sit in the loggia to-night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waiting for the moon to rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She will not rise till midnight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then she will rise, a poor half wreck of herself.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No whippoorwill has sung to-night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And none will sing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_271" id="page_271">[271]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if there are youths and maids and children<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hurrying into the dance on the water,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Embracing and fading in light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shall not see.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No, in this darkness where I breathe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The scent of the sweet alyssum<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which you planted and tended<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shall wait for midnight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the rise of our ruined moon.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In the darkness of the loggia<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under a sky that hopes for no moon to-night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save the wasted moon of midnight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am filled with a deep happiness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a thankfulness to the Power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behind the sky:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am filled with a joy as wide and deep as nature<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That my love for you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can live without your love for me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And asks nothing of you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nothing for you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save that you find what you seek!<br /></span>

<p class="c">Author of “Sadhana,” “The King of the Dark Chamber,” etc.</p>

<p class="nind">Fruit Gathering</p>

<p>Perhaps of all Tagore’s poetry the most popular volume is “Gitanjali.”
It was on this work that he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.
These facts lend special interest to the announcement of this book,
which is a sequel to that collection of religious “Song Offerings.”
Since the issue of his first book, some four years ago, Tagore has
rapidly grown in popularity in this country, until now he must be
counted among the most widely read of modern poets. Another volume of
the merit, the originality, the fine spiritual feeling of “Gitanjali”
would even further endear him to his thousands of American admirers.</p>

<p class="nind">The Hungry Stones and Other Stories</p>

<p>Some of the more notable of Mr. Tagore’s short stories are here
presented in translations by the author and with illustrations by native
Indian artists. Ernest Rhys, in his biography of Tagore, devotes much
space to a consideration of him as a short story writer, advancing the
opinion that this particular form of literature is one of the most
important expressions of Tagore’s genius. Now for the first time English
readers are given the opportunity of acquainting themselves with the new
Tagore and of forming their own estimate of him. None of the material in
this volume has ever appeared before in English.</p>

<p>Probably few people are following as closely the poetry of to-day as are
the editors of the <i>Poetry Magazine</i> of Chicago. They are eminently
fitted, therefore, to prepare such a volume as this, which is intended
to represent the work that is being done by the leading poets of the
land. Here, between the covers of one book, are brought together poems
by a great many different writers, all of whom may be said to be
responsible in a measure for the revival of interest in poetry in this
country. The volume is unusual, not only in the number of names which it
contains, but in the splendid insight which it gives into a literature
which seems to be coming once more into its own.</p>

<p>California is now to have its part in the poetry revival. Robinson
Jeffers is a new poet, a man whose name is as yet unknown but whose work
is of such outstanding character that once it is read he is sure of
acceptance by those who have admired the writings of such men as John G.
Neihardt, Edgar Lee Masters, Edwin Arlington Robinson, and Thomas Walsh.
Virtually all of the poems in this first collection have their setting
in California, most of them in the Monterey peninsula, and they realize
the scenery of the great State with vividness and richness of detail.
The author’s main source of inspiration has been the varying aspects of
nature.</p>

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
